## What is it?

`torchns` is a nested sampler with a slice sampling exploration scheme based on [torch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) library. It is designed to be integrated with the [swyft](https://github.com/undark-lab/swyft) sequential simulation-based inference code.

Its main features are:
- Vectorized evaluations of slice sampling chains to draw new live points.
- Vectorized evaluations of the log-likelihood.
- Functionality to define constrained prior regions, useful for sequential simulation-based inference applications. 
  

## Installation

- Change directory to wherever you would like to store the library, then run:
```
git clone https://github.com/undark-lab/torchns.git # for https client
[or git clone git@github.com:undark-lab/torchns.git # for ssh client]
```
- Making sure that the desired python environment is active, run the following installation code:
```
cd torchns/
pip install .
```
- This will install `torchns` in the current python environment that is active on your system and will be available via `import torchns`
